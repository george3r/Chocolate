Kokoa Kamili pays a premium--well above the market rate--to farmers for their ‘wet’ cocoa, and conducts its own fermentation and drying. By taking over the fermentation and drying process, Kokoa Kamili can produce more consistently higher quality cocoa beans. This method gives farmers a reduced workload, along with greater compensation, and the farmers are paid immediately after the cooperative receives its wet beans. The cocoa is fully box fermented in locally sourced and constructed eucalyptus three tier boxes. The typical fermentation length is 6 days with turns on days three and five. The beans are 100% sun-dried on raised drying tables. The Area: The catchment area borders the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, an area known for its abundance of bird and mammal wildlife. It is most famous for the eleven different primate species, bird life, and is one of three remaining sites that support Savannah Elephants in a mountainous environment. Current estimates of 2,000 elephants reside in and around the Udzungwa area. Social Impact. Prior to Kokoa Kamili’s Cooperative a single buyer dominated the area – the local arm of one of the world’s largest soft commodity trading houses. A sole buyer meant it had the power to set the price for cocoa, and farmers had little alternatives. Historically, farmers in the Kilombero Valley received some of the lowest prices for cocoa in the country.

Put them in for 10 minutes, stirring at 5 minutes (and every 5 minutes after this). At 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 320 and roast another 10 minutes. Pull out a handful of beans for comparison. Turn off the oven and let the remaining beans set/roast for a final 10 minutes in the cooling oven. Remove them and let them cool. This should give you a nice light delicate roasted bean. For the Behmor 1600, load 2 lbs on P1 or P2 (1 lb setting) for 17-19 minutes. That should also give you a nice roast. If at a point it starts to smell sharp, you most likely are done or roasting too hot (if it's early in the roast). If you are fortunate enough to have a drum roaster with bean probe, I like this taken to a surface bean temperature of 262-268 F, although if you extend it a bit to 270 F some of the fruit notes will drop and nut and sugars will be high lighted.\"},\n",

By taking over the fermentation and drying process, Kokoa Kamili can produce more consistently higher quality cocoa beans. This method gives farmers a reduced workload, along with greater compensation, and the farmers are paid immediately after the cooperative receives its wet beans. The cocoa is fully box fermented in locally sourced and constructed eucalyptus three tier boxes. The typical fermentation length is 6 days with turns on days three and five. The beans are 100% sun-dried on raised drying tables. The Area: The catchment area borders the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, an area known for its abundance of bird and mammal wildlife. It is most famous for the eleven different primate species, bird life, and is one of three remaining sites that support Savannah Elephants in a mountainous environment. Current estimates of 2,000 elephants reside in and around the Udzungwa area. Social Impact. Prior to Kokoa Kamili’s Cooperative a single buyer dominated the area – the local arm of one of the world’s largest soft commodity trading houses. A sole buyer meant it had the power to set the price for cocoa, and farmers had little alternatives.

       "  'roasting': \" If you oven roast, I suggest the following. Pre-heat your oven to 350 F. Put a pound of beans into a heavy corning ware type container, about an inch deep. Put them in for 10 minutes, stirring at 5 minutes (and every 5 minutes after this). At 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 320 and roast another 10 minutes. Pull out a handful of beans for comparison. Turn off the oven and let the remaining beans set/roast for a final 10 minutes in the cooling oven. Remove them and let them cool. This should give you a nice light delicate roasted bean. For the Behmor 1600, load 2 lbs on P1 or P2 (1 lb setting) for 17-19 minutes. That should also give you a nice roast. If at a point it starts to smell sharp, you most likely are done or roasting too hot (if it's early in the roast). If you are fortunate enough to have a drum roaster with bean probe, I like this taken to a surface bean temperature of 262-268 F, although if you extend it a bit to 270 F some of the fruit notes will drop and nut and sugars will be high lighted.\"},\n",

Soft cashew, raisin and a silkiness are the overall impression. There is a lingering high note in the finish of bittering spice and baked raisin. In many ways it puts me in mind of an English pudding. There is no astringency or bitterness to speak of. The preparation of these reddish beans is spectacular.

       "  'details': 'Kokoa Kamili currently works with approximately 1,500 small shareholder farmers, most of whom farm between 0.5-2 acres of cocoa. Kokoa Kamili pays a premium--well above the market rate--to farmers for their ‘wet’ cocoa, and conducts its own fermentation and drying. By taking over the fermentation and drying process, Kokoa Kamili can produce more consistently higher quality cocoa beans. This method gives farmers a reduced workload, along with greater compensation, and the farmers are paid immediately after the cooperative receives its wet beans. The cocoa is fully box fermented in locally sourced and constructed eucalyptus three tier boxes. The typical fermentation length is 6 days with turns on days three and five. The beans are 100% sun-dried on raised drying tables. The Area: The catchment area borders the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, an area known for its abundance of bird and mammal wildlife. It is most famous for the eleven different primate species, bird life, and is one of three remaining sites that support Savannah Elephants in a mountainous environment. Current estimates of 2,000 elephants reside in and around the Udzungwa area. Social Impact. Prior to Kokoa Kamili’s Cooperative a single buyer dominated the area – the local arm of one of the world’s largest soft commodity trading houses. A sole buyer meant it had the power to set the price for cocoa, and farmers had little alternatives. Historically, farmers in the Kilombero Valley received some of the lowest prices for cocoa in the country. In Kokoa Kamili’s first year alone Kilombero farmers received the highest prices in Tanzania for their cocoa. ',\n",
       "  'roasting': \" If you oven roast, I suggest the following. Pre-heat your oven to 350 F. Put a pound of beans into a heavy corning ware type container, about an inch deep. Put them in for 10 minutes, stirring at 5 minutes (and every 5 minutes after this). At 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 320 and roast another 10 minutes. Pull out a handful of beans for comparison. Turn off the oven and let the remaining beans set/roast for a final 10 minutes in the cooling oven. Remove them and let them cool. This should give you a nice light delicate roasted bean. For the Behmor 1600, load 2 lbs on P1 or P2 (1 lb setting) for 17-19 minutes. That should also give you a nice roast. If at a point it starts to smell sharp, you most likely are done or roasting too hot (if it's early in the roast). If you are fortunate enough to have a drum roaster with bean probe, I like this taken to a surface bean temperature of 262-268 F, although if you extend it a bit to 270 F some of the fruit notes will drop and nut and sugars will be high lighted.\"},\n",

First impressions are a soft, velvety fig flavor and a lovely chocolate flavor laced through with nut and a light earthy flavor.

Collection locations are located along one stretch of road running through the Galiraya, Kisonko and Buganikere communities. Cacao from these locations is blended throughout the process. \\n The Rwenzururu sub-region of Uganda sits at 3,000 feet above sea level and borders the DR Congo, the Rwenzori Mountain range and Semuliki National Park. The climate is tropical with over 1,000mm of rainfall which typically occurs in 2 seasons, March to April and September to January. The region suffers from recurring conflict between cultural and rebel groups straddling the DR Congo border. Bundibugyo district likely accounts for more than 70% of cocoa production in Uganda. \\n Wet cocoa is purchased from over 500 contracted smallholder farmers, each with 1-2 hectares of cocoa trees, often divided between several plots. Staff collect cocoa in the afternoon of harvest day from contracted farmers from established collection points near the farms. Farmers are paid cash on the spot for fresh cocoa at 40% of the dry cocoa market price. 10-20% bonuses are then paid to farmers at the end of the season based on delivered volumes and consistency of deliveries (required 1x per month to ensure consistency of source material). \\n The fermentation facility and store is located in a converted B&amp;B in the village of Bumate at the base of the hills leading into the mountains. With a shortage of available land in the district, the site is designed to take advantage of all possible available sunshine while limiting runoff from heavy rainfall. \\n Paired box fermentation built with eucalyptus timber sourced from local timber plantations. Boxes are 500kg capacity with removable shutters to allow turning cacao for uniform fermentation. Fermentation temperatures are recorded at regular intervals 3x daily. Total duration of fermentation varies from 5.5-6.5 days. \\n The quality of fresh cacao is evaluated by bag and hand sorted prior to filling of fermentation boxes. Any lower grade or cacao harvested on the previous day is separated. Beans are sampled and cut from the start of the 5th fermentation day onward. Prior to drying, beans are again separated based on quality of fermentation and consistency within the box. After drying and sorting, beans are sampled and cut to sort fermentation levels prior to blending. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis mixture of varieties combined with frequent collaboration with Daniel O’Doherty of Cacao Services, produces a unique profile\\n \\xa0 \\n Dan's influence in the fermentation is quite clear with a very even, beautiful and full fermentation.\\xa0 You can taste another bean collaboration with Peru Ucayali \",\n",

A slight sweetness of light molasses and dried cherry. First impressions are nutty (pistachio) and minerally (dry tannins). It is a soft and slightly meek or reserved flavor profile that opens up as you continue. There is a malic acidity that permeates the profile. It’s a low toned vs bright acidity. The kind of bracing tang you get from dried dates, prunes and even certain dried meats like prosciutto. It mixes together to lend the impression of a dry red wine with good solid but not over bearing tannins. There are hints of bergamot (Earl Grey tea) and sarsaparilla. There are also tart bing cherry and strawberry and touches of licorice. At times there is even the impression of root beer. Great if you love that kind of thing, possibly off putting if you do not.

       "  'characteristics': \" Origin: Republic of Congo Region: North Kivu province Type: Mostly Forastero Certifications: Direct Trade, Certified Organic, UTZ Year: 2018/19 It is a rare day when I get to bring in a brand new Origin, and this is one of those times.\\xa0 To date I've tasted and evaluated beans from the Congo a few times but this is the first time I both liked them enough and they were viable to offer. \\n This may sound odd but the first word that comes to mind about the aroma of this bean is tannins.\\xa0 Maybe it is that it is wine like but that is what I get.\\xa0 Also very prominent is warm summer raisins – that fruity, slightly sharp sweet smell. \\n I need to say up front that I really like this bean and it may come across that I’m kind of damning it with faint praise.\\xa0 The issue, if you can call it an issue, is that it is mostly Forastero and although that can make quite a flavorful chocolate it is pretty common to be not incredibly complex.\\xa0 With that in mind, let’s forge on. \\n The flavor is low toned with a nice almond nuttiness.\\xa0 The acidity is remarkably low but the mellow nuts make it very approachable.\\xa0 It is savory, with notes of tamarind and molasses.\\xa0 Overall this is a solid and well structured bean that won’t disappoint as long as you don’t go putting the bar higher than it should be. \",\n",
       "  'details': ' Esco Kivu pioneered cacao production in the Democratic Republic of Congo decades ago in the North Kivu province. \\n The region has seen tremendous growth over the years as both weather and soil have led to production of superior quality, flavorful cacao. A remarkable success story for the Eastern Congo community, the emergence of cacao production provides hope for bright future of sustainable income generation and continued growth potential.\\xa0 \\n The Esco Kivu team continues to demonstrate a commitment to the wellbeing of farmers in DRC by providing them with materials and education necessary to cultivate cacao and manage income. Farmers have been provided fermentation boxes and ongoing training on topics such as farm maintenance and post-harvest techniques, social responsibility, youth education, and managerial development. This organically and sustainably grown cacao shines as leader for west African production. \\n ',\n",
       "  'roasting': \" Goldilocks.\\xa0 You don't have to fear over roasting this accidentally but you really will do best keeping this in the center zone.\\xa0 Too light and the astringency goes up.\\xa0 Too heavy and the nuts are going to turn bitter.\\xa0 That means both not pushing the ramps too hard and also not going too high.\\xa0 250-258 F is a good zone with a solid 4-5 minutes in the finishing phase. \\n The roast profile for my evaluation was 12.00/2.45/5.15 @ 258 F.\\xa0 The EOR was just a higher than some taking into account the bold\\xa0Amelonado chocolate character .\\xa0 \\n If you are using a Behmor, P1 for 18-20 minutes with 2 lb will be just fine.\\xa0 Go by the aroma.\\xa0 When it turns sharper near the end of the count down, you are done.\\xa0 If it isn't there yet, add a bit more time waiting for the turn of aroma. \"},\n",

This is to ensure quality of handling by the transport agency, timeliness ,insurance coverage reliability. We will no longer ship by Airline Cargo as was the practice until now. \\nShipping costs a fortune and several times the actual cost of the\\n goods, but the silver lining is that it is door delivery. \\n 2) There is NO WARRANTY on any units shipped directly from India. Spectra, Santha or SanthaUSA\\'s support will be limited to provision of free spares and shipping in case of manufacturing defects within the first 60 days. In case of damages during transit, then, the customer will be reimbursed the full amount as received from the carrier, regardless of whether it is more or less than the billed amount. For issues occuring after 60 days, we will provide free spares, but customer has to pay for shipping. \\n Again, the above is not because there is no confidence in the product, but more so because of the very nature of the product, our inability to support a product in a distant and foreign location where we have no local agent and due to freight conditions over which we have no control over from the point the goods leave the factory. \\n \\n Finally, the price listed DOES NOT include any Custom\\'s or port charges individual destinations may charge, only the cost of the unit and delivery to the location you specify. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Also, these units are not available as part of Kits. Any kit listing a Melanger is for USA deliveries only. ',\n",

We have been experimenting, and have verified that if you get your nibs very clean, the Stone Melanger will also grind the nibs to liquour, saving the Champion step. Personally I find it a bit tedious for a large batch because you can only add a few ounces at a time, but the choice is yours. \\n The Melanger has two 7.5# black granite \"stone\" rollers that rotates at 120 rpm on a granite slab and two scraper arms. This creates tremendous shear and reduces the particles of sugar and cocoa to the smoothness we expect in modern chocolate, somewhere in the 1-30 micron range.

This is to ensure quality of handling by the transport agency, timeliness ,insurance coverage reliability. We will no longer ship by Airline Cargo as was the practice until now. \\nShipping costs a fortune and several times the actual cost of the\\n goods, but the silver lining is that it is door delivery. \\n 2) There is NO WARRANTY on any units shipped directly from India. Spectra, Santha or SanthaUSA\\'s support will be limited to provision of free spares and shipping in case of manufacturing defects within the first 60 days. In case of damages during transit, then, the customer will be reimbursed the full amount as received from the carrier, regardless of whether it is more or less than the billed amount. For issues occuring after 60 days, we will provide free spares, but customer has to pay for shipping. \\n Again, the above is not because there is no confidence in the product, but more so because of the very nature of the product, our inability to support a product in a distant and foreign location where we have no local agent and due to freight conditions over which we have no control over from the point the goods leave the factory. \\n \\n Finally, the price listed DOES NOT include any Custom\\'s or port charges individual destinations may charge, only the cost of the unit and delivery to the location you specify.

After that, between noon and early afternoon, they bring the bags by foot or on bikes to the harvest center, where they\\xa0 are weighed and payed directly by weight and quality. The price is generally agreed at the start of the harvest and varies if there are more or less to pick. People are free to sell to the best offer or take home. \\n The beans go then straight into special designed wooden fermentation boxes. The post harvest protocol was developed in 2003 and is mainly adapted to the size of the beans including slow sun drying. \\n\\xa0\\n \\xa0Roasting \\n The first thing you should do is read my Ask the Alchemist 239 where I discuss roasting smaller beans.\\xa0 \\n After that, you can treat this bean pretty aggressively as there is tons of chocolate and fruit.\\xa0 If you are drum roasting that means 10/8/6\\xa0 F/min is just fine.\\xa0 You want to pay attention to the aroma and reduce your ramps if you smell it trying to be acrid.\\xa0 You will also stop the roast a little sooner than you might normally since the bean is smaller.\\xa0 EOR 252-258 F seems to work well where a normal sized bean of this character would be 258-264 F. \\n In the Behmor, P1 with 2.5 lbs of beans for 18 minutes is a good sweet spot.\\xa0 If you are only roasting 2 lbs then pay attention to sharp aromas near the end of the roast and stop at that point.

       "  'characteristics': \" \\xa0Description \\n \\xa0Origin:\\xa0 Dominican Republic \\n \\xa0Region: Reserva Zorzal \\n \\xa0Crop: 2019 \\n \\xa0Type: Hispanola - Trinatario \\n \\xa0Certs: Certified Organic and Direct Trade \\n \\xa0Flavor Notes: \\n This year is yet another glorious fruit bomb.\\xa0 It is a touch more restrained and elegant the previous years but still big and beautiful. The aroma is saturated with cherry and raspberry and a sweetness that is on the verge of cloying.\\xa0 It makes me think of Magnolia.\\xa0 It is mouth wateringly intense.\\xa0 It is big and bold but also very well rounded and not sharp at all. \\n The flavor of cherry comes charging out of the gate with the cherry liquor Kirsch right on its heels.\\xa0 Overall it is a low acidity, or maybe it is simply that the fruit is so high that is seems lower than it is. The cherry is tart cherry.\\xa0 Once all that starts to fade away there are touches of apricots and peach. \\n The cherry a turns to notes of sweet, heavy burnt sugar on the end that does an admirable job of balancing the sweetness and fruit. It is a balancing bitterness.\\xa0 The flavor ends on a lower note with just a little earthiness and just the barest hint of light...smoke isn't the right word...char?\\xa0 That smell just after you melt and caramelize the sugar on a Crème Brule. \\n Oh, the chocolate. Sorry, I was distracted by the fruit.\\xa0 Yep, chocolate there.\\xa0 Pretty typical of Hispanola, but missing that very dry tannic note and dustiness I often see.\\xa0 This is clean and has a great clarity of flavor.\\xa0 The mouth feel is unsurprisingly full. \\n Details \\n This is a cocoa bean you can feel really good about. \\n First, it makes wonderful chocolate. Fine bean-to-bar makers like Blue Bandana, Hummingbird, Dandelion Chocolate, Raaka, Parliament, Cacao Sante Fe, and ChocoSol, make signature bars out of it. \\n Second it’s direct trade. We buy it directly from Zorzal Cacao with no middlemen. Charles Kerchner is a consulting forester who worked in the DR in the Peace Corps. He fell in love with the landscape, and at the time also fell in love with cocoa (he was a Chocolate Alchemy customer back in our early days). Working with partners and landowners in the DR, they formed a team that initiated the first private reserve in the Dominican Republic, as part of the National Protected Area System. Reserva Zorzal has become a model for private landowners to participate in landscape-level conservation. \\n Third it’s organic. Zorzal Cacao has a story that goes well beyond just being organic and direct trade. Reserva Zorzal has set aside 70% of its 1,019 acres as “forever wild”, devoted to the wintering grounds of Bicknell’s thrush, which of course benefits biodiversity and many other species. This rare and threatened bird breeds on remote mountaintops in the Northeastern United States. Seeing or hearing one is a rare treat even for experienced birders, and its habitat in dense hemlock forests makes even getting the chance of seeing one or hearing its nasal trill the thrill of a lifetime. It winters in the DR, where it is called the Zorzal de Bicknells, in the dense cloud forest, and because its habitat is shrinking both in its wintering grounds and breeding grounds, cooperative efforts between conservation organizations in the United States and the DR are forging real progress in maintaining populations of this rare songbird. \\n Roasting \\n This is a versatile bean.\\xa0 Roasts taken to 240-245 will have fewer caramel notes but may lack chocolate notes.\\xa0 250-255 F brings out the chocolate. 260-265 really allows this bean to sing. There is fruit enough to carry through whatever you do. \\n I personally like this bean roasted a touch heavier than many. In general, try giving this bean an extra 2-3 minutes roasting at a slightly hotter (10-15 F) temperature than you normally would for many beans and see what you think. I\\xa0 wait until I hear a few beans popping, and still give it a 2-3 minutes. \\n \\xa0I've used this oven roasting profile to good success: \\n \\xa0Pre-heat your oven to 370 F. Put a pound of beans into a heavy corning ware type container, about an inch deep. Put them in for 15 minutes, stirring at 5 minutes (and every 5 minutes after this). At 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 330 and roast another 10 minutes. Pull out a handful of beans for comparison.

Gone are the blueberry and blackberry, replaced by dried cherry and fig. Just smooth, silky chocolate. While roasting there is toasted cashew nuts, soft graham cracker and a lovely dried cherry. Once in chocolate form (80% for my tests) there is a huge dried cherry and floral component. There is sweet dried fig note that moves to dried cherry and raisin the farther you take the degree of roast. There is gentle tobacco and full grain leather and a solid chocolate laced all throughout with a utterly lovely dense creamy mouth feel. \\n Rounding it out is a moderate mineral quality and lime pith astringency that lends depth to the whole profile. \",\n",

It used to be solely the bailiwick of Green and Black, but actually getting more than just lovely samples from them proved impossible. This is a great collaboration between Cotton Tree Lodge and Maya Mountain Cacao (MMC), the former housing the fermenting and drying beds (which I\\'ve watched grow, changed and mature over the years) for the later. This is direct from MMC, and sums it up great. \"Maya Mountain Cacao (MMC) sources premium cacao (cocoa beans) from smallholder Belizean farmers for makers of fine chocolate products. Our model creates an exceptionally high-quality cocoa bean and a growing source of income for farmers, while contributing to reforestation efforts and promoting sustainable organic agricultural practices in southern Belize.\" Now, THAT\\'S what I\\'m talking about when I speak of Direct trade and Sustainable sourcing. Moving onto the beans and the great chocolate it can produce. ',\n",

Go for it, have fun, and enjoy - that's what this journey is all about anyway. \\n In this particular case I kept the EOR lower to bring out some balancing brightness but kept the Finishing phase long (5 minutes) so that there was full heat penetration to the core of the bean so astrigency is kept in check.\\xa0 The profile curve associated with the spider chart is 12.5/2.5/5 @ 248 F. \"},\n",
